## 9. User Expectations & Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

| Best Practice | Why It Helps |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Be specific with dates** | "Leave for January 25th" works better than "leave for someday" |
| **Use simple language** | Short, clear requests are understood best |
| **One request at a time** | Ask for one thing, complete it, then ask for the next |
| **Check the response** | Read what the AI says before taking action |
| **Use quick action buttons** | They're designed for the most common tasks |
| **Ensure good internet** | A stable connection gives the best experience |

### ❌ Don'ts

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Very long messages** | Keep requests under a few sentences |
| **Multiple requests at once** | "Apply leave AND download payslip" may confuse the AI |
| **Expecting memory** | Don't say "same as before" – the AI doesn't remember past sessions |
| **Sensitive information** | Don't share passwords or financial details in chat |
